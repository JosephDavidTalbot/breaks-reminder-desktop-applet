# breaks-reminder-desktop-applet
 A simple python script that can be configured to nag you to get up and take a walk for five minutes every hour. Eminently configurable.

# Why This Exists:
 I was recently diagnosed with ADHD, and started taking medication for it. I then discovered a problem: while ADHD not allowing me to sit still and focus for long periods was bad for my productivity, it was great for my body, and when medication made me stop fidgeting and adjusting and getting up and pacing for no reason, I started getting serious back pain. So after some wrangling and talking to my aunt about yoga, I made this script and polished it up to the point I'm comfortable sharing it with the world.

# TODO:
- Find a more elegant way to fire off timed reminders than polling and sleeping for a second. Current solution is much more performant than polling without sleeping, but that's not saying much.
- UI to allow for setting specific days off the reminders.
- UI to allow for custom reminder messages.
- Saving and loading to remember your custom settings.

# breaks-reminder-desktop-applet
 A simple python script that can be configured to nag you to get up and take a walk for five minutes every hour. Eminently configurable.


# TODO:
- Find a more elegant way to fire off timed reminders than polling and sleeping for a second. Current solution is much more performant than polling without sleeping, but that's not saying much.
- UI to allow for setting specific days off the reminders.
- UI to allow for custom reminder messages.
- Saving and loading to remember your custom settings.
